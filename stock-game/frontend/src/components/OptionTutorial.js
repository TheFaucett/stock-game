                At this point you may be looking at making your first trade, but before you do I wanted to let you know about a feature of the app that isn't super common sense about trading. ðŸ§ ðŸ¤¯
            </p>
            <p>
                This simulation allows you to perform an option (if you're a pro sports fan, it's similar to a "player option" in the MLB or NBA).
            </p>
            <p>
                The TLDR of an option is a contract that allows one the ability to buy or sell an asset at a specific price, called the "strike price".
            </p>
            <p>
                My simulation uses a very simple version of this with only calls and puts, so if you want to know more about options and/or how I use them in the app, check out the following:

        <button onClick={onClose}>Okay, got it!</button>    
      </div>

export default OptionTutorial;
